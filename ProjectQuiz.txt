What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?  List and explain at least FOUR advantages in using a CDN.
A CDN  is a large distributed system of servers deployed in multiple data centers across the Internet
it is also an alterniative to hosting JQuery yourself. 
1) you dont have to host it yourself, making faster load times
2) People have already visted websites where they automatically download JQuery, so it will load faster since you arent hosting it
3) You wont have the same capacity or scalability offered by major CDNs which means less packet loss faster load times
4) CDNs provide localized data centers which are closer to users, meaning faster load times
